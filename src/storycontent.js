        description:"We got a call to rescue a very sick street puppy. We found him hiding in a plastic bag, and the moment we touched the bag he screamed in pain. He was desperately hungry so we could coax him out with biscuits, but every time we tried to touch him he cried out. He had severe mange and a deep wound on his hip that was causing him the shooting pains every time he moved.This dear little boy was in so much pain and agitation, his worried eyes never relaxed for even a moment in the first several days after rescue. But after 6 weeks of medicine and care, meet Jumper today! Please donate to be the reason someone heals today"
