        description:`The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[1] It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and both descend from the line of northern spitz-type dogs.Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her reign.[2] Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.[3] However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold annual Corgi Meetups in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate to spend the day.The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed is considered an excellent working dog.
        According to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 13th most popular breed of dog in 2018.The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be "fox-like" in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg.[6] The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth.[7]
        Being a double-coated dog, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds heavily all year around, with peaks in the spring and autumn. With regular brushing, their coat is fairly easy to maintain, as well as naturally water- and dirt repellent (at the exception of "fluffies"). Intact females are also known to shed during heat.[8]
        Breed faults exist and should not be bred on purpose; such as corgis with a very long and thinner coat coming from a recessive gene[9] and red coats present with a bluish cast which have a diluted colour.
        While some outlying Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short, the majority often have their tails docked between 2â€“5 days old due to historical tradition or to conform to the Breed Standard. [10] Artificial docking was not needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom as many claim (since Cardigan Welsh corgis were also herding dogs but never docked) but rather because a non-herding dog was considered a luxury under tax law and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked tails. The Kennel Club,[11] the United Kennel Club,[12] and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches (5 cm). In many countries including the United Kingdom, docking has been deemed illegal`
